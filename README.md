Enigma Machine Simulation

This program is mean to simulate the MV3 Enigma Machine from WWII. This machine was used, by the Germans, to encrypt messages that were going to be sent by telegraph. 

In this simulation, I have provided various text files that represent each component of the Enigma Machine: it rotors, reflector, and the plug board. Currently, only the rotors actually represent how the actual Enigma Machine was set up. The other two component just had a random configuration.
